1 Functions for Xtensa Processors
*********************************

This chapter describes machine-dependent functions that are included in
the C library when it is built for Xtensa processors.

* Menu:

* setjmp::      Save stack environment
* longjmp::     Non-local goto

1.1 'setjmp'--save stack environment
====================================

*Synopsis*
     #include <setjmp.h>
     int setjmp(jmp_buf env);

   *Description*
'setjmp' and 'longjmp' are useful for dealing with errors and interrupts
encountered in a low-level subroutine of a program.  'setjmp' saves the
stack context/environment in 'env' for later use by 'longjmp'.  The
stack context will be invalidated if the function which called 'setjmp'
returns.


   *Returns*
'setjmp' returns 0 if returning directly, and non-zero when returning
from 'longjmp' using the saved context.


   *Portability*
'setjmp' is ANSI C and POSIX.1.

   setjmp requires no supporting OS subroutines.

1.2 'longjmp'--non-local goto
=============================

*Synopsis*
     #include <setjmp.h>
     void longjmp(jmp_buf env, int val);

   *Description*
'longjmp' and 'setjmp' are useful for dealing with errors and interrupts
encountered in a low-level subroutine of a program.  'longjmp' restores
the environment saved by the last call of 'setjmp' with the
corresponding 'env' argument.  After 'longjmp' is completed, program
execution continues as if the corresponding call of 'setjmp' had just
returned the value 'val'.  'longjmp' cannot cause 0 to be returned.  If
'longjmp' is invoked with a second argument of 0, 1 will be returned
instead.


   *Returns*
This function never returns.


   *Portability*
'longjmp' is ANSI C and POSIX.1.

   longjmp requires no supporting OS subroutines.
